# native_swiftui_pastebutton_and_textfield

This is a plugin that provides a paste button and text field from Native SwiftUI as widgets in Flutter.

This plugin requires Xcode to build, and the executable iOS version must be 16.0 or higher.

## Please ensure you check.
In Xcode, you must set the iOS build version to 16.0 or higher.
Upon initial launch, the iOS target version occasionally reverts to its previous setting, so please double-check.
I'm not sure if there's a way to specify the minimum deployment version in the plugin. 
If you know how to set the minimum deployment version within a plugin, please let me know.
